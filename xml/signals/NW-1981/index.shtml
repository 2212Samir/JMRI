N&amp;W 1981 Signaling Definition
</h1>

This directory contains signaling definitions corresponding to 
the Norfolk and Western 1981 rule book.
<p>
The 2 arm version of the NW CPLs are illustrated using two complete round faces.  In the field, the actual signal may not have included a complete face depending on the indications needed at a given location. In general, a two arm signal would be used at an interlocking or as the advance signal for an interlocking.  Signal installations at the end of a siding may only have a single head.  In those instances I reused the clear signal icon and renamed it to diverging clear to get the system to work properly in JMRI.  A number plate was drawn on the Rule 291 signal to show a stop and proceed indication.
<p>
The single arm absolute signals include a single marker for the stop and stay indication.  
<p>
The rule book illustrates two versions of the NW CPL dwarf.  Early versions of this style dwarf had the arc from 12 to 3-o-clock position.  Due to clearnance issues, the arc was change to the 9 to 12-o-clock position.  I don't know if this changed the aspects the signal could display.  I am assuming that either version could display the up to 4 aspects.  There is a stop and proceed version that includes a numbner plate.  The left lower red light is mapped to lunar based on the later version of the signal.

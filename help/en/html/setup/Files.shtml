<h1>JMRI Setup: Configuration Files</h1>

<p>This section attempts to explain
what the Configuration Files contain and where they are located.
</p>

<dl>
	<a name="location">
	<dt class="left">Configuration File Locations</dt></a>
	<dd class="first">
	There are two places where JMRI Configuration Files can be found:
		<ol>
		<li>The originally-distributed versions of JMRI Configuration Files live in an
		'xml' directory in the JMRI application package and its subdirectories.
		Note that anything you modify here will be lost when you update JMRI to a
		new version.
		
		<li>The user's JMRI Preferences directory and its subdirectories. JMRI looks here
		first for any files it needs. You should put any locally-modified
		versions of files here so they don't get overwritten by a JMRI update.
		Any files that the program writes to containing local
		information, e.g. Roster entries and Panel files, are also written here.
		<br>
		The default user's Preferences location varies by computer operating system.  
		Normally, it's located:
			<ul>
			<li>On a Linux machine, look for a .jmri directory in your home
			directory.
			</li>
			<li>On Mac OS X, Preferences are stored in a "JMRI" directory
			in the
			Library/Preferences folder in your user directory.
			</li>
			<li>On Windows, this can be in a number of places depending on
			which Windows version you're running and whether you have
			multiple users configured. Start by looking under "Documents"
			or "User Documents" or "Users and Documents".  You're looking
			for a folder called "JMRI".
			</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p>The easiest way to find it is to start a JMRI program, e.g. DecoderPro or PanelPro, 
		and select "Locations ..." from the "Help" menu. A special treat
		for Windows users: if you go to the Windows Start Menu, in the JMRI section, 
		you can select "Preferences" to have it open that directory for you.
		<br>
    You'll know you've found the right place if you see the
		Preferences files that store your applications settings:
		<tt>DecoderProConfig2.xml</tt>, <tt>PanelProConfig2.xml</tt> and/or
		<tt>LocoToolsConfig2.xml</tt>.</p>
		<p>You may set or change the location scripts and user files in the <a href="../../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#FileLocations">Preferences... -&gt; File Locations</a> panel.	Note that
		changing the "User Files Location" will also change the default location for Panels, Rosters etc.	
		</li>
		</ol>

	</dd>
	
	<dt class="left">Types of Configuration Files</dt>
	<dd>
	Inside your Preference folder are a number of types of configuration
	files:
		<ul>
		<li>Decoder definitions - Stored in the 'decoders' subdirectory; these
		define how a specific family of decoders is configured.
		<li>Locomotive configurations - Stored in the 'roster' subdirectory;
		these record the specific configuration of each Locomotive in your
		Roster.
		<li>Programmer definitions - Stored in the 'programmers' subdirectory;
		these define the formats for the various programming sheets that are
		available in Decoder Pro.

		</ul>
	</dd>
	
	<dt class="left">General Configuration Files</dt>
	<dd>
	There are also general JMRI Configuration Files, shared by all applications, which live in the
	top-level xml or prefs directory:
		<ul>
		<li><tt>roster.xml</tt> - an index of your Locomotives
		<li><tt>decoderIndex.xml</tt> - an index of the available decoder
		definition files. It also contains the information on which specific
		decoder model uses which file, how to identify them, and what options
		they implement.
		<li><tt>names.xml</tt> - not used during normal operation, this is a
		list of the standard Variable Names for use in programmer definitions.
		</ul>

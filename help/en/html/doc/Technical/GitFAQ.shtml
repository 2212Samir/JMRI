<h1>JMRI: Git FAQ</h1>

<em>Note that this page is under development.  JMRI
is considering migrating to using Git instead of Subversion (SVN).
Until that's decided and done, this page isn't relevant for 
JMRI users.</em>

  <p>This is a list of Frequently Asked Questions for Git,
     particularly regarding how we use it with JMRI.</p>

  <p>See also the <a href="index.shtml">Technical index</a>
     for more information on maintaining JMRI code.</p>


<h3>Embedded Properties</h3>

When JMRI was originally using CVS, we used lines like:

<code>
<pre>
# The next line is maintained by CVS, please don't change it
# $Revision$
</pre>
</code>

as an additional way of tracking file versions.  When we migrated to 
SVN, we kept those in certain files, like decoder XML, properties files, etc,
that users are likely to edit and submit back for inclusion.  

<p>
But with Git, there's really no good way to maintain these automatically,
and very little need for them. 
So we'll be removing these lines as time allows.
If you're working on a file and happen to see one, usually
in the header, you can just delete it.  (If it has somebody's name,
you might want to add that to the copyright notice if there is one.)

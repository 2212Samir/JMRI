<h1>JMRI: Git FAQ</h1>

<p>This is a list of Frequently Asked Questions for Git,
   particularly regarding how we use it with JMRI.</p>

<p>There's a
<a href="getgitcode.shtml">separate page</a>
on how to 
<a href="getgitcode.shtml">get the code with Git</a>.</p>

<p>See also the <a href="index.shtml">Technical index</a>
   for more information on maintaining JMRI code.</p>

      <dl class="faq">

	<dt id="install" class="on">How do I install Git?</dt>
	<dd>
	      Git is free software.  Depending on your computer type and your preferences,
	      there are several ways to install it. There's more info in the Git community's
	      <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">Getting Started</a> guide.

	      <UL>
	      <li>Get it from the <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Git download page</a>.
	      <li>It comes with the GitHub Desktop application,
		  available from the <a href="https://desktop.github.com">Git desktop download page</a>.
	      <li>On the Mac, it's included when you <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/">install XCode</a>.
	      <li>On Linux you can use your package installer, e.g. <code>sudo yum install git</code> or <code>sudo apt-get install git</code>.
	      </ul>
	</dd>

      <dt>Setting up a GIT environment for JMRI Developers</dt>
      <dd>
	You can set your local repository to pull automatically
	from the JMRI master on GitHub and push to your fork (also on GitHub):
	<p>
	<img src="/pub/John/images/GitHubWorkflow.png">
	<p>
	That horizontal arrow is the “Pull Request” (and subsequent
	pull) that records information about how things get into
	the repository.
	<p>
	The arrows are both operations (push, pull) and also
	definitions of _where_ to look e.g. a URL.  Git can store
	shorthand for a URL, called a “remote”.  The default remote
	is called “origin”.  You can have many remotes defined.
	<p>
	You do this with this command on the command line as follows:
	<blockquote>
		<code>$ git remote set-url --push origin https://github.com/<em>username</em>/JMRI.git</code>
	</blockquote>
	where username is your github user name.  You can check the
	current status with of the push and pull repositories with:
	<blockquote>
		<code>$ git remote -v</code></br>
		<code>origin    https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI.git (fetch)</code><br/>
		<code>origin    https://github.com/<em>username</em>/JMRI.git (push)</code><br/>
	</blockquote>

	This says that, by default, fetches and pulls come from the
	main JMRI/JMRI repository.  When you push, on the other hand,
	it goes to your own repository.
	<p>
	Once you have a copy of your changes on GitHub, it is easy to 
	<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/">generate a pull request</a> (link to GitHub):
	<ul>
	<li> In a browser, navigate to the repository on GitHub that has the changes you want someone else to pull and
	<li> press the Pull Request button.
	<li> After your pull request has been reviewed, it can be
	     merged back in to the main JMRI/JMRI repository.  The
	     JMRI developer who "pulls" your changes into the
	     community source needs to have access to an online
	     repository that has your changes, which is why you
	     need to have a place on GitHub...
	</ul>
	</dd>

	<dt>Working with GIT</dt>
	<dd>
	      With SVN and CVS, you're check out a &quot;working directory&quot; to make your
	      changes in, work in it for a while, and eventually commit all your changes back to the main repository.
	      <p>
	      Git works on a different idea. 
	      Instead of multiple working directories, you have a single repository that's been
	      &quot;cloned&quot; from the main repository.  If you're making individual little
	      changes, you can work directly on the default &quot;master&quot; branch within it.  If not,
	      see <A href="#branch"> Branching</a>, below.
	      <p>
	      To understand Git, it is good to know about the various <em>places</em> in your 
	      local git repository:
	      <ul>
		      <li> The content from the "remote" repo, which lives under the <code>.git/</code> hidden directory,</li>
		      <li> The "staging" area (also called &quot;index&quot; or &quot;cache&quot;), and </li>
		      <li> The "branch" you are using, which lives in</li>
		      <li> The working tree.</li>
	      </ul>

	      When you <i>clone</i> a git repo, you are creating a directory structure that holds 
	      all of these items.  Unless you tell it otherwise, the working tree starts off 
	      filled with contents of the <em>master branch</em> of the repo you cloned - and the <em>staging 
	      area</em> is empty.  As you make changes to the files in the working tree, you need
	      to explicitly <em>add</em> them to the staging area. Git knows about these files, but 
	      they aren't yet officially part of your local repo.  
	      <p>
	      Once you have populated the staging area with of all the things you have changed, a 
	      <em>commit</em> operation will, uhm, officially commit your changes to your repo's 
	      <code>.git/</code> structure.
	      <p>
	      When you <em>pull</em> or <em>push</em>, you are telling Git to synchronize your <code>.git/</code> 
	      content with that of the remote repo you originally cloned things from.
	      <p>
	      The following command reference should get you started.

	      <ul>
	      <li> Log in to GitHub and clone your own copy of the main JMRI repo.  
		      This will give you a safe place to push and pull from without impacting others.
	      <li> Clone the JMRI repo to your local system (or update it):
		      <blockquote>
			      <code>$ git clone https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI.git   </code><br/>
		      or <br/>
			      <code>$ git fetch                                    </code><br/>
			      <code>$ git diff ...origin                           </code><br/>
			      <code>$ git merge origin/master                      <br/>
			      Auto-merging ... files ...	<br/>
			      CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <em>some_file</em><br/>
			      Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.<br/>
			      $ vi <em>some_file</em> # the file has the conflicts marked, edit to fix...<br/>
			      $ git add <em>some_file</em><br/>
			      $ git commit -m "Merged master fixed conflict"<br/>
			      $ git merge origin/master                      </code><br/>
		      or <br/>
			      <code>$ git pull https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI.git    </code><br/>
		      </blockquote>
	      <li> Make your changes locally, test them, etc
		      <blockquote>
			      <code>$ git add <i>newfile</i>                       </code><br/>
			      <code>$ git rm <i>newfile</i>                        </code><br/>
			      <code>$ git add .                                    </code><br/>
		      <br/>
			      <code>$ git status                                   </code><br/>
		      <br/>
			      <code>$ git fetch                                    </code><br/>
			      <code>$ git merge                                    </code><br/>
		      <br/>
		      </blockquote>
	      <li> make your changes available to the community
		      <blockquote>
			      <code>$ git commit -m <i>"commit message"</i>       </code><br/>
			      or <br/>
			      <code>$ git commit -a -m <i>"commit message"</i>    </code><br/>
		      </blockquote>
	      </ul>

	<dt id="migrateSVN">Migrating un-committed changes from a SVN checkout</dt>
	<dd>
	      If you have changes to the JMRI code in an existing SVN checkout, here's what we recommend:

	      <ol>
	      <li>&quot;Update&quot; to the HEAD of SVN. You should be doing this routinely anyway, 
	      because you'll need to do it before your changes can eventually be submitted.  
	      Do this now and solve any problems.
	      <blockquote>
	      <code>$ svn update</code>
	      </blockquote>

	      <li>Check the status and save the output.  Double check that no conflicts are showing.
	      <blockquote>
		      <code>$ svn status</code><br/><br/>
		      save a copy to reference later ...<br/><br/>
		      <code>$ svn status &gt; saved-status.txt</code>
	      </blockquote>

	      <li>Diff the sources and save the output.
	      <blockquote>
	      <code>$ svn diff &gt; patch.txt</code>
	      </blockquote>

	      <li>Clone a copy of the JMRI Git repository on your machine.
	      (See the <a href="getgitcode.shtml">previous page</a> for detailed instructions.)
	      <blockquote>
	      <code>$ git clone https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI.git</code>
	      </blockquote>

	      <li>In your new Git repo clone, checkout the sources as they were when the code was switched from SVN to Git:
	      <blockquote>
	      <code>$ git checkout tags/svn-30001</code>
	      </blockquote>
	      This sets your working copy to be exactly the same as the last contents of SVN, 
	      the same as the base for the <code>svn diff</code> you took earlier.<br/>

	      <li>Apply the changes you had made in SVN to the new Git tree
	      <blockquote>
	      <code>$ patch -p0 &lt; patch.txt</code>
	      </blockquote>

	      <li>If you had created any completely new files in the SVN working directory, 
	      i.e. ones with &quot;A&quot; or &quot;?&quot; status:
		  <ul>
		  <li>Copy those files into the corresponding place in your Git checkout.
		  <li><em>Add</em> them to the Git staging queue:
		      To <code>git add (pathname)</code> on each of them to tell Git about them
		      <blockquote>
		      <code>$ git add <em>pathname/to/new/file</em></code>
		      </blockquote>
		  </ul>

	      <li>Check the status to get a list of changes.
	      <blockquote>
	      <code>$ git status</code>
	      </blockquote>
	      You should see the same list of changed files as the &quot;svn status&quot; you ran earlier.<br/>

	      <li><code>git stash save</code>

	      <li><code>git checkout master</code>

	      <li><code>git stash pop</code><br/><br/>
		      Depending on how much progress has taken place in Git, 
	      this might show some conflicts.  If so, you have to resolve them here.

	      </ol>  
	      Now you can start developing, without having lost anything.
   </dd>

   <dt id="branch">Branching</dt>
   <dd>
	      If you're making individual little
	      changes, you can work directly on the default &quot;master&quot; branch.
	      If you want to work on something more complicated, good "Git Hygiene" encourages you
	      to create a feature branch so you can work on it independently.  
	      Branches in Git are easy and cheap to create and use; you can have multiple branches at the same time, 
	      and switch between them as you work on different projects.

	      <p>
	      We recommend that you name branches starting with your initials (for example, "abc") and something that suggests what you are working on:  
	      <code>&quot;abc-decoder-xml-change&quot;</code>, 
	      <code>&quot;abc-2015-09-14&quot;</code>, 
	      <code>&quot;abc-next-cool-thing&quot;</code>, and
	      <code>&quot;abc-patch-NNNN&quot;</code>
	      are all fine.  With the initials, we know it's you, and you can sort out the rest.

	      <p>
	      To create a branch called &quot;<em>branchname</em>&quot;, you do <br/>
	      <blockquote>
	      <code>git checkout -b <em>branchname</em></code><br/>
	      </blockquote>

	      The &quot;-b&quot; says to create the branch.  To switch to an existing branch, just leave
	      out that option:<br/>

	      <blockquote>
	      <code>git checkout <em>branchname</em></code><br/>
	      </blockquote>

	      To see all the current branches, do<br/>

	      <blockquote>
	      <code>git branch</code><br/>
	      </blockquote>

	      If other people in the community make changes to the master branch, you can keep your 
	      branch up to date by merging those changes in with your branch<br/>
	      <blockquote>
	      <code>
	      git checkout <em>branchname</em><br/>
	      git merge -m"merging in current contents of master" master
	      </code><br/>
	      </blockquote>

	      (If you leave off the message option, you'll be prompted to add one in an editor) If any
	      changes were picked up and merged in, you can then commit them to your branch:
	      <blockquote>
	      <code>git commit -a</code><br/>
	      </blockquote>

	      When you're done, merge your changes back into the common line of development with<br/>

	      <blockquote>
	      <code>
	      git checkout master<br/>
	      git merge -m"merging to master" <em>branchname</em><br/>
	      git commit -a
	      </code>
	      </blockquote>
	      
	      You can then delete your branch (if you're finally done 
	      with it) with<br/>
	      
	      <blockquote>
	      <code>
	      git checkout master<br/>
	      git branch -d branchname
	      </code>
	  </blockquote>
      </dd>

<dt id="CVSCookies">Embedded CVS, RCS and SVN cookies</dt>
      <dd>
	      When JMRI was originally using CVS, we used lines like:

	      <code>
	      # The next line is maintained by CVS, please don't change it<br/>
	      # $Revision$
	      </code>

	      as an additional way of tracking file versions.  When we migrated to 
	      SVN, we kept those lines in certain files, like decoder XML, properties files, etc,
	      that users are likely to edit and submit back for inclusion.  

	      <p>
	      But with Git, 
	      <!-- 
		  there's really no good way to maintain these automatically,
		  http://thomas-cokelaer.info/blog/2014/12/moving-from-svn-to-git-id-equivalent/
 
		  see .git/info/attributes
		  # see man gitattributes
		  # expands $Id$ but not $Revision$ $Author$
		  *.xml ident
	      -->
	      there's less need for these. 
	      So we'll be removing these lines as time allows.
	      If you're working on a file and happen to see one, usually
	      in the header, you can just delete it.  (If it has somebody's name,
	      you might want to add that to the copyright notice if there is one.)
      </dd>
	      
<dt id="SFnetPatches">Handling a SF.net Patch</dt>
      <dd>
	      Eventually, we'll move from using the
	      <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jmri/patches/">SF.net issue tracker</a> to 
	      <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">GitHub issues</a>
	      to handle code that people want to contribute.
	      In the meantime, here's a suggested way to handle a SF.net patch.

	      <ol>
	      <li>In your local repository, create a branch to hold the patch:
		      <blockquote>
		      <code>
			      git checkout -b patch-NNNN
		      </code>
		      </blockquote>			
		      where NNNN is the patch number.
	      <li>Merge in the changed code as needed.
	      <li>Commit your changes:
		      <blockquote>
		      <code>
			      git commit -m"Patch-NNNN plus the patch subject line (author name)"
		      </code>
		      </blockquote>			

	      <li>It's now in your repository on a branch of it's own, where you can sanity test things as usual.
		      
	      <li>When you are happy, push your local repo's committed content to your GitHub repository 
	      (assuming the default configuration, where "push" goes to your
	      own repository on GitHub) with 
	      <blockquote>
	      <code>git push origin patch-NNNN</code>
	      </blockquote>
	      
	      <li>Go you your repository on GitHub and start the "pull request" process.
	      <li>On the second screen, switch the branch being compared in your repository from
	      "<strong>master</strong>" to "<strong>patch-NNNN</strong>".  Then the rest of the pull request goes as before.
	      <li>Eventually, a JMRI maintainer will handle the pull request and merge it, which will
	      put the patch changes on the master branch in the repository.
	      <li>You can wait for the merge to the main repository, and then perform a 
	      <blockquote>
		      <code>git pull</code>
	      </blockquote>
	      to update your local repository with this patch on the 
	      master branch.  Or, if you need them sooner,
	      you can immediately merge these changes onto your local master via
	      <blockquote>
	      <code>
	      git checkout master<br/>
	      git merge patch-NNNN<br/>
	      </code>
	      </blockquote>
	      </ol>

	      The advantage of this approach is that it lets you keep all your own work separate 
	      from any patches you're handling.  The patches are on different branches than your work,
	      so they don't overlap.

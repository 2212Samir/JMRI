  <h1>JMRI: Getting the Code (Git Version in Development)</h1>

<em>Note that this page is under development.  JMRI
is considering migrating to using Git instead of Subversion (SVN).
Until that's decided and done, this page isn't relevant for 
JMRI users.</em>

  <h2>Quickstart</h2>

  <p>You can download a bare copy the most recent JMRI source code
  by going to our 
  <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/jmri-test">GitHub.com repository</a> 
  and clicking the "download ZIP" button on the right.</p>
  
  <p>Note that this will give you a bare copy. If you want to make
  changes, and hopefully contribute them back to the JMRI project 
  so others can benefit from them, we recommend that you use 
  the "Clone in Desktop" button instead.  This will 
  require you to have installed
  "<a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub Desktop</a>" tool, which you can get from 
  <a href="https://desktop.github.com">here</a>.
  See below for more info.
  
  <h2>Details</h2>


  <p>Our source code is distributed using <a
  href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a>.  (We also keep
  the <a href="WebSite.shtml">web site</a> in Git, if you'd like
  to work with the source for that directly.)  
  If you want to work with the code, a few
  minutes installing Git is well worth it.  We're sorry, but we
  just can't support other methods (sending around individual files, etc), as they're
  just too error prone.</p>

  <p>We host our primary copy of the code in a repository on
  <a href="">GitHub.com</a>.  That provides powerful (and free) tools
  for managing the code in a community way.
  
  <p>It's possible to use Git from the command line, or from inside various 
  IDEs like XCode or NetBeans.  Some of the JMRI developers prefer that approach.
  But if you're new and reading this, we recommend that you 
  interact with our code repository through the
  "<a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub Desktop</a>" tool.
  Download it via <a href="https://desktop.github.com">this link</a>,
  install it and take the tutorial.
  
  <p><em>
  Note: GitHub Desktop is not (currently) available on the Linux platform. 
  As a result, it might be necessary to locate and install the needed client 
  software suitable for your flavor of Linux.  See the
  <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git downloads</a> 
  page for packages for many operating systems.  Alternatively, check the
  usual package manager for your flavor of Linux.
  </em></p>

  <p>Many development environments (e.g., Netbeans or Eclipse) will have
  support for Git, either directly or as an add-on.  Check the
  documentation for your favorite IDE to check on Git support.</p>

  <p>
  <em>(Paragraph not changed:  Decide whether to put in a 
  command here, or a GitHub Desktop walkthrough)</em>
  If you have an existing copy of the code and want to update it
  to the most recent contents of the Subversion repository, the command is:
  <pre>
  svn update
  </pre></p>

  <p>See also the <a href="GitFAQ.shtml">JMRI Git FAQ page</a>.</p>

  <p>After the checkout is complete, you'll find a top level
  directory called <tt>java</tt>, with subdirectories <tt>xml</tt>,
  <tt>resources</tt>, <tt>jython</tt>, <tt>help</tt>, <tt>lib</tt>,
  <tt>java</tt> and others.</p>

  <p>Change to the <tt>java</tt> directory.  There, you will find a <tt>src</tt>
  directory that contains the source code for JMRI itself, and a <tt>tests</tt>
  directory that contains various test routines.</p>

  <p>You can look at the code with your favorite text editor.  To
  compile and run it, you need one of the compilation tools described
  on the bar at the left: <a href="Ant.shtml">Ant</a>, <a
   href="Eclipse.shtml">Eclipse</a>, <a
   href="NetBeans.shtml">NetBeans</a>, <a
   href="JBuilder.shtml">JBuilder</a>, etc.  (Ant may be the easiest to
  install and use, and is the primary example in the documentation)</p>

  <p>Once you're working with the code, you'll probably create some improvements
  you'd like to contribute back to the project.  This is where Git has tremendous
  advantages; with the appropriate permissions and commands, you can merge your
  changes back into the common source automagically.  Contact us when you're ready to
  do that or see the <a href="index.shtml#contributing">info on
  contributing</a>.</p>

  <h2>Access to Old Releases</h2>

  <p>The best way to retrieve the source for releases 4.1.1 and earlier
  is from the <a href="getsvncode.shtml">SVN Repository</a>.  Please
  see those instructions for details.</p>

  <p>The best way to retrieve the source for releases 2.12 and earlier
  is from the <a href="getcvscode.shtml">CVS Repository</a>.  Please
  see those instructions for details.</p>

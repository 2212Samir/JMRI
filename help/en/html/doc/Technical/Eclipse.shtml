	<H1>JMRI: Building with Eclipse</H1>

	<p>
		Eclipse (available at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">www.eclipse.org</a>)
		makes a great platform for working with JMRI.
	</p>

	<p>
		Eclipse is a complex environment to work with. If you're already
		familiar with IDEs like Microsoft Visual Studio it won't be too hard
		to get used to, but it is definitely worth buying a textbook (e.g. <a
			href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321305027/qid=1124158635">
			The Java Developer's Guide to Eclipse</a>).
	</p>

	<P>
		JMRI developers use Git for source control. Source control using Git
		is including as part of the Eclipse "Luna" download. For more
		information or an alternate method for getting the JMRI source, see <a
			href="getgitcode.shtml">JMRI: Getting the Code</a>.
	</P>

	<P>These instructions were developed and tested using "Eclipse IDE
		for Java Developers" version "Luna Service Release 1a (4.4.1)".</P>
	<P>Also note that at the time of writing this help document that
		JMRI requires JAVA version 8. You must confirm that JRE 8 is the
		default Java Runtime Environment. Eclipse recommends installing
		release Luna for Java 8, but there are workarounds described online.</P>

	<h2>Getting the JMRI Source using Git</h2>

	To get the source code from SourceForge using Git you need to do the
	following:

	<OL>
		<LI>Go to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub.com</a> and create
			an account.
		<LI>Then open Eclipse.</LI>
		<LI>From the main menu bar select "File" then "Import..."</LI>
		<LI>Click on "Git" then "Project from Git" then the "Next"
			button.</LI>
		<LI>Now select the repository source by clicking on "Clone URI".
			The Source Git Repository screen should appear.</LI>
	</OL>

	<img src="images/EclipseSourceGitRepository.png">

	<OL>

		<LI>Enter the URI "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI".</LI>
		<LI>Enter your GitHub username and password in the authentication
			fields.</LI>
		<LI>Click the "Next" button and the Branch Selection screen
			should appear.</LI>

	</OL>

	<img src="images/EclipseGitBranchSelection.png">

	<OL>

		<li>Select the branches you want to install. If you're not sure
			which branches you need, select just the "master" branch. This branch
			contains the latest code for JMRI.</li>
		<LI>Click the "Next" button and the Local Destination screen
			should appear.</LI>
		<LI>Press the "Next" button if the local destination is
			acceptable to you.</LI>
	</OL>

	<P>After the download is complete the Eclipse Package Explorer
		should look like this:</P>
	<img src="images/EclipsePackageExplorer.png">
	<P>After the download is complete, Eclipse will be reporting an
		error: Project 'jmri' is missing required source folder: 'java/tmp'.
		This will be fixed by running the ant build as described below.
	<h2>Building and running JMRI using Ant</h2>

	We recommend that before you try and build and run one of the
	applications within Eclipse that you run the ant build.xml within
	Eclipse. This will create the necessary directories, load some resource
	icons, and create needed Java files using JavaCC. To run the ant
	build.xml you need to do the following:

	<OL>
		<li>Ant needs a JDK (Java Development Kit) in order to run the
			supplied "build.xml" file. The Eclipse download doesn't include a
			JDK, so you must download and install a JDK, and then configure ant
			to use the JDK.
		<li>Here's a link to the Oracle site that can provide you with a
			JDK:
			<P>
				<a
					href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>
			</P>
		</li>
		<li>Select the build.xml file using the Package Explorer, then
			right click, and a menu should appear.</li>
		<li>Now select "Run As" then "2 Ant Build".</li>
		<Li>Confirm that under the menu tab JRE that you've selected a
			JDK, not a JRE.</Li>
		<LI>Now press the "Run" button, this should start the ant build.</LI>

	</OL>

	<P>If the ant build fails, most likely it is because you need a JDK
		(Java Development Kit) rather than a JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
		which is the default. To change the JRE, select "Run As" "2 Ant Build"
		and a new window should appear. Select the "JRE" tab. The change the
		JRE, select the "Separate JRE:" radio button, and then press the
		"Installed JREs" button. If you don't see a JDK, you need to add one
		(from site above).</P>

	<P>If the ant build succeeds, you can now launch any of the JMRI
		applications from ant, and create a jmri.jar file if you wish. Use the
		"2 Ant Build" and in the window select the "Targets" tab, and use the
		appropriate checkbox to generate what you want.</P>

	<h2>Building and running JMRI using Eclipse</h2>

	<P>After completing the ant build as described above, you need to
		refresh the jmri directory. Right click on the jmri directory name and
		select "Refresh". The refresh operation should trigger a build of the
		workspace and the build should complete without error.
	<P>To run an application do the following:</P>

	<ol>

		<LI>You need to verify the compiler compliance level is set to
			java 1.8. Select under the main control bar "Window-&gt;Preferences",
			then select "Java-&gt;Compiler".
		<LI>From the "Run" menu, select "Run Configurations..." We'll use
			the window that opens to configure which program(s) to run. (If the
			Run menu does not have a "Run Configurations..." entry, be sure you
			selected the java directory in the navigation pane above - Eclipse
			menus are context sensitive)</LI>

		<LI>On the left side, highlight "Java Application", then press
			the "New" icon above it. The icon looks like a document with a plus
			sign on the upper-right.</LI>

		<LI>You should now have a new "Main" tab highlighted. Above that,
			replace "New_configuration" with "DecoderPro". Below it, enter "jmri"
			(lower case important) for "Project:" and
			"apps.DecoderPro.DecoderPro" for "Main class:".</LI>

		<LI>Select the "Arguments" tab, and under VM argments enter (You
			should probably cut and paste): <BR> <PRE>
-Xms10m
-Xmx300m
-Djava.security.policy=lib/security.policy 
-Dapple.laf.useScreenMenuBar=true
</PRE> If you're using a 32 bit windows system add the library path: <PRE>
-Djava.library.path=.;lib;lib/windows/x86 
</PRE> Note if you're using a 64 bit windows system change the library path
			to: <PRE>
-Djava.library.path=.;lib;lib/windows/x64
</PRE>
		</LI>

		<LI>Optional, select the "Common" tab, the section on "Display in
			favorites menu", check the boxes next to "Run" and "Debug"</LI>

		<LI>If you'd like to create targets to make it easy to run
			PanelPro and AllTests, repeat the above steps to create a new "Java
			Application" except specifying "apps.PanelPro.PanelPro" and
			"apps.tests.AllTest" respectively.</LI>

		<LI>Click "Apply", then "Close" (You could click "Run" at this
			point, but we've got a little more to do)</LI>

		<LI>You should now be back to the usual Eclipse navigator view,
			where most development work is done. To see some particular java
			file, expand the "java" folder at the left, then the "src" folder,
			navigating down to the file you want.
		<LI>To run DecoderPro, select it under "Run History" from the
			"Run" menu. Once you've done that once, you can just click the "Run"
			icon on the toolbar to rerun the last program.
	</ol>

	<H2>Installing JavaCC Plugin (alternative to Run As Ant Build
		method above)</H2>

	Instead of using the ant build to populate the "tmp" directory, you can
	install the JavaCC plugin. Here's the steps:
	<P>
		1) Download the Eclipse JavaCC plugin following the instructions found
		here: <A HREF="http://eclipse-javacc.sourceforge.net">http://eclipse-javacc.sourceforge.net</A>
	<p>2) After restarting Eclipse, right click on the java directory
		in the Project Explorer or Navigator and select JavaCC Options.
	<p>3) On the JavaCC Options tab, enter the output directory to be
		java/tmp/jmri/jmris/srcp/parser
	<p>4) On the JJTree options page, enter the output directory to be
		java/tmp/jmri/jmris/srcp/parser
	<p>5) Confirm that the "Java Build Path" includes the tmp directory
		(see Project Properties).
	<H2>Pushing changes to your GitHub branch</H2>

	The standard practice is to push your code changes to your GitHub
	repository and request a "pull" to the "master" on the GitHub website.
	Before you can push your changes to GitHub, you must "Fork" the JMRI
	repository. Log on'your you account at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub.com</a>
	and then navigate to the JMRI repository <a
		href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI</a>
	In the upper right hand corner of the page you will find a button
	labeled "Fork". Press the "Fork" button to create your own branch of
	the JMRI source. When you commit and push your code changes, they will
	go to your own branch first, and later will be pulled into the "master"
	repository for JMRI.

	<P>To perform a push, right click on the project in Eclipse that
		you want to commit, and select "Team" followed by "Commit". Enter a
		commit message and select the files you wish to commit. To push to
		your GitHub repository, again select "Team" and then "Push Branch". In
		the "Push Branch to Remote" window, press the "New Remote" and enter a
		name for your branch, and the URL of your GitHub repository along with
		your username and password. Press "Finish" when you're done.</P>
		
		<P>To request a "pull" to the JMRI "master" go to your JMRI repository on
		GitHub and click on the "Pull Request" button.


	<H2>Compiler Errors and Warnings</H2>

	The default Eclipse compiler configuration produces many unnecessary
	warnings. You can adjust the warnings to match the screen shots as
	shown below by going to Window-&gt;Preferences and selecting
	"Java-&gt;Compiler-&gt;Errors/Warnings"

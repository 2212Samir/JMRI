    <h2><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>NetBeans 7.2 (available at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">www.netbeans.org</a>)
    makes a great platform for working with JMRI.
    The JMRI code is setup to work with NetBeans with almost no
    additional setup.
    (The description below is accurate for the Windows version of NetBeans 7.2.
    NetBeans is <i>supposed</i> to be identical across platforms, but this hasn't 
    been checked on anything else). </p>
    <p>NetBeans is a very powerful Integrated Development Environment (IDE),
    which can make working with the JMRI code pretty easy.  But it takes a little
    getting used to, and reading the tutorials on the 
    <a href="http://netbeans.org/community/releases/72/">NetBeans 7.2 web site</a>
    will be helpful.
    </p>

    
    <h2><a id="installing">Getting and Installing NetBeans</a></h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Download NetBeans 8 or late (The Java SE version is fine) from 
            <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">www.netbeans.org</a><br>
		(If you don't yet have Java Development Kit 8 (JDK) installed on your
            system, download a JDK-NetBeans bundle - on the NetBeans download page, 
            look for a link similar to "JDK with NetBeans IDE Java SE bundle".)</li>
        <li> Run the NetBeans package installer</li>
    </ul>
	<p></p>
	<p>Many Linux distributions have NetBeans available in their software repositories
	- search your package manager for NetBeans.</p>
    
    <h2><a id="checkout">Checking out code</a></h2>
    <p>GitHub provides JMRI's code repository using the Git tool.  
        NetBeans provides built-in support 
        for Git functionality.  NetBeans Git support may be configured in either 
        of two ways, depending on how the user wishes to interact with the Git 
        repository.</p>

  <li>In NetBeans, under the "Team" menu, select Git, then Clone Repository.
    Enter the https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI.git repository URL from the 
    <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">JMRI GitHub page</a>
    on the NetBeans form under "Repository URL".  We recommend that you
    also enter your GitHub user name and password on the form, so 
    we can attribute your contributions to you later. Click "Next".
    Make sure that the "master*" box is checked to pull down the main
    version of the code. Click "Next", and then click "Finish".
    <p>
    It'll take quite a few minutes to pull down a copy of the code
    (note the progress bar in the lower right), 
    but then you're good to go.
    
    <h2>Local Commits</h2>
    
    When using Git, the "commit" operation is local to your computer.
    It doesn't make any changes to the main JMRI repository.
    <p>
    You're encouraged to commit often, so that your changes are safely stored
    away from your working directory.

    <h2><a id="updating">Updating the code from Git</a></h2>

    <p>From time to time, you should update your local copy of the code to match 
        the current "head" of the sourceforge.net JMRI Git repository contents. 
        To do this, use the NetBeans [Team]-&gt;[Update] menu choice.</p>
    <p>You may also update a single file or the contents of a folder, by
        right-clicking on an item in the "Files" window, then selecting 
        [Subversion]-&gt;[Update].</p>
    

    <h2><a id="buildandrun">Building and running JMRI</a></h2>
    <p>    To build and run DecoderPro, all you have to do is select
           "Run Project (JMRI)" from the Run menu, or click the Run icon in the tool bar.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Run -> Run Project (JMRI)  <em>will compile and invoke DecoderPro</em>
        <li><em>You can choose other targets (i.e. PanelPro...) by changing 
                [File]-&gt;[Project Properties (JMRI)]-&gt;[Build and Run]-&gt;[Run Project]</em>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you want to run the program under the NetBeans debugger,
        first set JMRI to be the Main project via [Run]-&gt;[Set Main Project]-&gt;[JMRI] then
        select "Debug Main Project" from the "Debug" menu.
    </p>

    <h2><a id="jar">Making a Jar File</a></h2>

    Most of the code in a normal JMRI installation lives in a file called
    jmri.jar.  If you want to replace this with your updated version, you
    need to create a new jmri.jar file from your modified code.  
    <P>
    To do this,
    ctrl-click (or right-click) on the name of the "JMRI" project in the
    "Projects" window.  This will open a pop-up menu, on which you'll
    find "Make Jar File". Select that, and a new jmri.jar file will be
    produced in the project's main directory.
    <p>Alternately, from the "Files" window, right-click on the build.xml file,
        and select "Run Target", then "jar".</p>
    
    <h2><a id="pullreq">Creating a Pull Request</a></h2>
    
    <p>A "pull request" is an easy way to gather up all your changes, even
    if they span multiple files, into one file that you can then submit
    for inclusion in the main JMRI repository.
    The process is quite simple with NetBeans
    First, you need to set up a GitHub account and your
    own repository. 
    Please see the page on 
    "<a href="gitdeveloper.shtml#repo">Being A JMRI Developer</a>"
    for instructions on how to do that.

    <p>
    Once that's set up, configure NetBeans to push your changes to that 
    repository.  D
    
    <p>
    To push the changes up, ...
    
    <p>Finally, when your change is ready to submit, go to the 
    GitHub web site and 
    <a href="gitdeveloper.shtml#pull">submit the pull request</a>.

    <h2><a id="nsis">Making a release package for Windows using NSIS</a></h2>

    <p>It is possible for NetBeans users to create a release package for use on 
        the Windows platform.  This requires installation of the Nullsoft Scriptable 
        Install System (NSIS), which can be downloaded from 
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis"> the NSIS project web site</a> 
        on SourceForge.</p>
    <p>Once NSIS is installed on the computer, it is necessary to create a file called
        local.properties in the same directory as JMRI's build.xml file.  This file is
        specifically <i>not</i> checked in via SVN, so that your machine-specific
        tool installation paths are <i>not</i> checked in to SVN.  Create the file, 
        and add a variable definition with the correct path to the directory which
        includes the NSIS executable, such as:</p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace">nsis.home=C:/Program Files (x86)/NSIS</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace">nsis.home=/opt/nsis/nsis-2.46/</p>
    <p>If you will be installing a "findbugs" tool, you will also define findbugs.home
        in this file.  You may also define several other machine-specific and 
        user-specific information as described in various locations in the 
        build.xml file.</p>
    <p>With the NSIS package installed to your computer, and build.xml properly 
            modified, the Windows package may be created by running the 
            "package-windows" ant target in build.xml.</p>

    <h2><a id="xmltools">Using NetBeans XML tools</a></h2>
    
    NetBeans has nice tools for working with XML files, including
    editing and validating them.  JMRI uses XInclude to include
    "fragment" XML files in other ones via URLs that point to
    the main JMRI web site:  http://jmri.org/xml/decoders/types/foo.xml
    JMRI programs convert these at run time to local file references,
    but by default NetBeans doesn't know to do this.
    <p>
    You can tell NetBeans how handle this by adding the 
    xml/catalog.xml file (from the JMRI distribution to 
    NetBeans
    at Tools -> DTDs and XML Schemas.
    This will allow NetBeans to use your local schema when validating an XML document in the editor. 
    Note that this is global setting in NetBeans, so if you are working on mutiple JMRI branches, 
    whichever branch you add the catalog from, that branch's schema is what is used.

    <h2><a id="findbugs">Running FindBugs</a></h2>

    <p>The FindBugs tool is a static code analysis tool which examines JAVA source code
        for common coding issues.  Installation of a FindBugs tool allows an ant task
        defined in build.xml to run FindBugs analysis across all of the JAVA source code
        in JMRI.</p>
    <p>It appears that the build.xml file is not configured to allow a NetBeans
        FindBugs "plugin" to run analysis on the JMRI code except on a one-file-at-
        a-time basis.  As such, it seems advisable to download and install the
        appropriate stand-alone FindBugs tool for your operating system.  FindBugs
        downloads may be found at <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net">the 
        FindBugs web site</a>.
    <p>Once you have the FindBugs tool installed, you must provide a path to the 
        directory containing the executable for use by the build.xml ant file.  
        If necessary, create the local.properties file in the same directory as 
        the JMRI build.xml file.  In the local.properties file, add the variable 
        findbugs.home with a path to the findbugs executable, such as:</p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace">findbugs.home=C:/findbugs-1.3.8</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace">findbugs.home=/opt/findbugs-1.3.8</p>
    <p>To run the FindBugs tool on JMRI code, execute the ant target "findbugs" 
        which is defined in build.xml.  Within NetBeans this can be accomplished 
        by right-clicking build.xml in the "Files" pane and "Run"ing the "findbugs" 
        target.  When FindBugs completes, the NetBeans Output window will show 
        the path to a report file in HTML format.  Open that file with a browser 
        to review the FindBugs results.</p>        


        <h2><a id="compileIndividualFile">NetBeans and compiling individual files</a></h2>
        <p>The NetBeans IDE shows icons to the side of each object in the Projects window,
            and to the side of each file in the Files window.  These icons can reflect the
            status of each item, including local change and proper compilation status.</p>
        <p>At this time, the files (in the project's nbproject/ directory) which 
            control how NetBeans performs individual file compilation, do not properly
            reflect all of the requirements of the JMRI project.  <i>Until these files
            are properly updated, the error icons will persist within the JMRI project.</i>
            These error icons do <i>not</i> affect the ability of NetBeans to compile the 
            source files using the Ant tasks defined in the project's build.xml file.</p>
        <p>Building the JMRI .jar file, and executing a JMRI tool from within
            NetBeans is generally done via Ant tasks, which are defined in the project's
            build.xml file.  JMRI's developers have generally kept this file up-to-date,
            so building the JMRI .jar file, and executing a JMRI tool from within NetBeans
            generally does not suffer from the shortcomings of the configuration information
            found in the files in the project's nbproject/ directory.</p>

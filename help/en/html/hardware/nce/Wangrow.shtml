      JMRI Hardware Guide: Wangrow System One
      </h2>

	<h3>Supported Hardware</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Wangrow System One
	</ul>

	<h3>Limitations</h3>

	<p>Some Wangrow command stations have an "optional analog control
	circuit". In these, pins 5, 6, and 9 are used with an analog
	voltage as a separate throttle. If you have one of these command
	stations, a normal 9-pin serial cable will not work! You'll need to
	make a custom cable that just connects the "send data", "receive
	data" and "ground" pins. See your Wangrow manual for details.</p>

	<h3>Setup</h3>

  <ol>
	  <li>To connect your computer to a Wangrow system, you can usually
	  just connect the command station to the computer's serial port
	  using a 9-pin serial cable.</p>

	  <li>Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program.
	  This opens automatically the first time a program is run, or you
	  can select it from the "Edit" menu.</p>

	  <li>Select "Wangrow" from the top selection box. You can then select
	  the proper serial port in the second selection box.</p>

	  <li>The baud rate selection box will be fixed at 9600 baud.</p>

	  <li>The series of radio buttons labelled "GUI style" allows you
	  to select how the program will look. "Metal" is the native Java
	  look available on all types. Other choices will vary with your
	  computer type. "Motif", "Windows", "MacOS" and "MacOS Adaptive"
	  look native on Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic" and Mac OS X
	  respectively.</p>

	  <li>In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default
	  programmer format. You can override this each time you open the
	  programmer, so this is here just for convenience.</p>

	  <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to
	  quit, click "Yes".</p>

	  <li>Restart the program. You should be up and running.</p>
  </ol>

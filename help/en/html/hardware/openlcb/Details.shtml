<h1> 
JMRI: OpenLCB Support Technical Details
</h1>

<em>The support on this page is rapidly evolving; the
actual code might be ahead or behind the documentation
on any given day.</em><p>

This page describes technical details of JMRI's
<a href="index.shtml">OpenLCB</a>
support.  See also the pages on JMRI's 
<a href="../index.shtml">general CAN support</a>.
<p>

<h2>CAN Adapters</h2>

JMRI's general approach is to support as many 
hardware combinations as possible. By supporting as many 
people and their hardware desires as possible, we 
can create a growing community of developers, hence more
code.

<p>
As part of this, JMRI CAN support is designed to
use as many CAN adapter types as possible.

<h2>Node ID</h2>
<p>
JMRI on an OpenLCB network acts, in part, like an OpenLCB node.
As such, it needs a unique 6-byte OpenLCB node ID.  
It builds this automatically every time it starts up.
It's built from the JMRI OpenLCB unique prefix,
along with one byte from the computer's IP address,
and two bytes of the process ID of the program.
This allows you to e.g. run JMRI on multiple computers
or multiple copies on ome computer without problems.
<p>
A future enhancement will make these persistent from run
to run, so that they can be used to create unique and persistent
eventIDs easily.

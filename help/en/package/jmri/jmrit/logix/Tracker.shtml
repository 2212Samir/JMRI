    	A Tracker is a means to to see the movement of trains on your layout panel. A marker 
    	identifying a train will move around your panel's layout diagram wherever an operator
    	drives his train.  The position of each tracked train is displayed in a window and log
    	is kept of their progress.
    	</p>
      <h1>What's Needed to Have a Tracker</h1>
      	<p>
      	Trackers function on the same foundation as do Warrants. That is, track occupation
      	detection by <b>OBlocks, Portals and Paths</b>. For detailed information about what 
      	these objects are and how to make
      	them see <a href="../display/CircuitBuilder.shtml">Circuit Builder</a>
      	or <a href="../OBlockTable.shtml">Occupancy Block Tables</a>. 
      	</p><p>
      	Next, your panel
      	layout diagram must done with Indicator Track icons. If your diagram has already 
      	been created using regular track icons, they can easily be converted to Indicator
      	Track icons with <b>Circuit Builder</b>. 
      	<a href="../display/ItemPalette.shtml">The Item Palette</a> has more information
      	about Indicator Track icons. all the track of your layout should be represented
      	with OBlocks, even the sections with no sensors. Although Tracker cannot detect
      	when a "dark block" is entered, it is smart enough to know when a train has
      	passed through one. So it is beneficial to configure them when there is a path
      	through them connecting one Occupancy block with another. 
      	</p><p>
      	The last requirement
      	is at least one Indicator Track icon must have its "<i>Display Train Name when 
      	occupied</i>" checkbox selected. This checkbox is displayed on the <i>edit</i> item
      	is selected from icon's popup menu when editing with <b>Control Panel Editor</b>.
      	</p>
      <h1>How to Make a Tracker</h1>
      	<p>
      	The <b>Warrants</b> menu has a <i>Train Trackers</i> item that opens the 
      	<b>Tracker Table</b> window. The table has a <b>New Tracker</b> button that
      	displays a Create Tracker dialog. Enter the name of the train and the block 
      	that it occupies to make a tracker for the train. The name will appear on
      	the track icon selected for display in every block the train occupies.
      	</p><p>
      	An much easier way to make a Tracker is simply to drag and drop a <b>Marker</b>
      	icon onto the block the train occupies. This opens the <b>Tracker Table</b> window
      	automatically and creates a Tracker with the text and color of the marker.
      	When a tracker is made this way, the marker will return to its docking position.
      	A marker's docking position can be set from it's popup menu.
      	</p><
       <h1>The Tracker Table</h1>
      	<p>
      	 The table consists of a list of the active trackers with their current status.
      	 This names the block and time where the train occupied the longest.
      	 A <b>Stop</b> button on each row will terminate the tracker.  Below the list
      	 is the <b>Last Event</b> status window. The events recorded are trains entering
      	 a block, leaving a block or any error or warning messages.  The time a 
      	 block has been occupied is also recorded. A mouse click on the window drops
      	 down a record of the last 20 events.  Below the status window are three buttons;
      	 the <b>New tracker</b> button which was mentioned above, the 
      	 <b>Refresh Tracker Info</b> button that will update the status of the active 
      	 trackers and the <b>OBlock Pick List</b> button that opens a list of the track
      	 circuits.
      	 </p>
       <h1>When Trackers Are Active</h1>
      	<p>
      	A tracker displays the blocks a train occupies by posting an identifying label
      	on the Indicator Track icon configured to display names when occupied. 
      	As blocks adjacent to the head or tail of its train becomes occupied or
      	unoccupied, the tracker updates the labels that are posted. When two or
      	more trackers have adjacent blocks in common and a common block becomes
      	occupied, a dialog is displayed for the 
      	panel user to determine which tracked train occupies the block.    
      	</p>

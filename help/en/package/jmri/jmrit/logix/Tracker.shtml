      <h1>Train Trackers</h1>
     	A <b>Tracker</b> is a means to to see the movement of trains on your layout panel. 
    	A Tracker has a marker identifying a train 
    	moving on your panel layout diagram following wherever an operator
    	drives his train on your layout.  The position of each tracked train and the time is spends 
    	occupying a block is displayed in a window. A status log
    	is kept of the progress of the trackers.

      <h2>What's Needed to Have a Tracker</h2>
      	Trackers function on the same foundation as Warrants. That is, track occupation
      	detection is by <b>OBlocks</b> and the directions trains move by
      	<b>Portals and Paths</b>. For detailed information about what 
      	these objects are and how to make
      	them see <a href="../display/CircuitBuilder.shtml">Circuit Builder</a>
      	or <a href="../OBlockTable.shtml">Occupancy Block Tables</a>. 
      	<p>
      	Next, your panel
      	layout diagram must done with Indicator Track icons. These icons display the status
      	of the block they represent with colors and can show names.  If your diagram has already 
      	been created using regular track icons, they can easily be converted to Indicator
      	Track icons with <b><a href="../display/CircuitBuilder.shtml">Circuit Builder</a></b>. 
      	The <a href="../display/ItemPalette.shtml">Item Palette</a> has more information
      	about Indicator Track icons.
      	</p><p>
      	All the track of your layout should be represented
      	with OBlocks, even the sections with no sensors. Although Tracker cannot detect
      	when such a "dark block" is entered, it is smart enough to know when a train has
      	passed through one. So it is beneficial to configure them when there is a path
      	through them connecting one occupancy block with another. 
      	</p><p>
      	The last requirement is each block should have
      	at least one Indicator Track icon configured to display names. The popup menu
      	of these icons has a "<i>Display Train Name when occupied</i>"
      	checkbox menu item when editing with <b>Control Panel Editor</b>. Select
      	it to show the current location of a tracked train.
      	</p>

      <h2>How to Make a Tracker</h2>
      	The <b>Warrants</b> menu has a <i>Train Trackers</i> item that opens the 
      	<b>Tracker Table</b> window. The table has a <b>New Tracker</b> button that
      	displays a Create Tracker dialog. Enter the name of the train and the block 
      	that it occupies to make a tracker for the train. The name will appear on
      	the track icon selected for display in every block the train occupies. As 
      	train moves track icons change colors and show the name of the tracker
      	<p>
      	An much easier way to make a Tracker is simply to drag and drop a <b>Marker</b>
      	icon onto the block the train occupies. This opens the <b>Tracker Table</b> window
      	automatically and creates a Tracker with the text and color of the marker.
      	When a tracker is made this way, the marker will return to its docking position.
      	A marker's docking position can be set from it's popup menu. Markers have
      	a menu to created and configure them when not in an editing mode.
      	</p>

       <h2>The Tracker Table</h2>
      	 The table consists of a list of the active trackers with their current status.
      	 The status names the block the train has currently occupied the longest.
      	 A <b>Stop</b> button on each row will terminate the tracker.  Below the list
      	 is the <b>Last Event</b> status window. The events shown are when a trains enters
      	 a block, leaves a block and any error or warning messages.  The time each 
      	 block has been occupied is also recorded. A mouse click on the window drops
      	 down a record of the last 20 events.  Below the status window are three buttons;
      	 the <b>New tracker</b> button which was mentioned above, the 
      	 <b>Refresh Tracker Info</b> button that will update the status of the active 
      	 trackers and the <b>OBlock Pick List</b> button that opens a list of the track
      	 circuits.

       <h2>When Multiple Trackers Are Active</h2>
      	A tracker posts an identifying label on all the blocks that
      	its train currently occupies.
      	Any block adjacent to the head or tail of its train becoming occupied
      	is assumed to be the move of the train.  However, when two or
      	more trackers have adjacent blocks in common and a common block becomes
      	occupied, which tracker has actually made the move indeterminate. 
      	When this happens a dialog is displayed for the 
      	panel user to determine which tracked train occupies contested the block.

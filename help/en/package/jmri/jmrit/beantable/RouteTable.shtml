<h1>The Route Table</h1>

<p>A Route consists of one or more Turnouts or Sensors that you
would like to control. Before creating a Route, you should first add
some Turnouts or Sensors by using either the Turnout Table or Sensors
Table. These tables can be found under the main menu "Tools -> Tables".

<p>Once you have some Turnouts or Sensors set up, use the "Add..."
button in the lower left hand corner of the Route Table pane to create a new
Route.

<h2>Route Table Columns</h2>

<dl>
	<dt>System Name</dt>
	<dd>The System Name cannot be changed once entered into the table.
	The "Add..." button located in the lower left corner of the pane allows
	you to add a new Route to the table.</dd>

	<dt>User Name</dt>
	<dd>You can directly enter or change the User Name for an
	existing Route.</dd>

	<dt>Set</dt>
	<dd>Pushing the "Set" button will trigger an existing Route.</dd>

	<dt>Delete</dt>
	<dd>Pushing the "Delete" button will remove the route from the
	table. 
	<p>
	Note that this doesn't remove the Route from any files you've
	saved that contain it. If you load one of those files, perhaps
	when you restart the program, the Route will reappear. 
	You should use one of the "Store to file" options in the "File"
	menu to save new versions of any files that contain this route.
	</dd>

	<dt>Enabled</dt>
	<dd>To disable a Route from triggering, uncheck the "Enabled" box
	for the Route. Enabled is not saved and will be restored when a Panel
	is loaded at startup.</dd>

	<dt>Locked</dt>
	<dd>When checked the Route is locked. This means that Turnouts
	included in the Route
	that can be locked by JMRI will not respond to commands from cabs or
	pushbuttons to change. For more information see the
	    <a href="TurnoutTable.shtml#Lock Mode">Lock Mode section</a> 
	    on the
	    <a href="TurnoutTable.shtml">Turnout Table page</a> 
        and the 
        <a href="#Turnout lock feature">section on the Turnout Lock feature</a>
	    below.</dd>

	<dt>Edit</dt>
	<dd>Push this button to edit the Route. For more information see <a
		href="RouteAddEdit.shtml">Adding/Editing Routes</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Route Table Controls</h3>

There is a button at the bottom of the Route Table:

<dl>	
	<dt>Add...</dt>
	<dd>Push this button to add a new route. For more information see
	<a href="RouteAddEdit.shtml">Adding/Editing Routes</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="Turnout lock feature">Turnout Lock feature</a></h2>

<p>The Turnout Lock feature allows you to selectively disable
accessory (Turnout) commands from cabs and/or locally-wired pushbuttons. JMRI
disables pushbuttons by sending pushbutton disable commands to the
Turnout decoders when the Route is locked, and enables the pushbuttons
when the Route is unlocked. When locking a Turnout from cab commands,
the JMRI program will monitor the Turnout's accessory address and if it
detects a change command from a cab, will cancel the command immediately
by sending out the opposite command to the Turnout. All Turnouts that
are being monitored by the JMRI program and are included in the Route
will be locked.</p>
<p>To help you select a set of Turnouts to lock or unlock, a Route
can be locked or unlocked. In the Route edit window, an optional Lock
Control Turnout is available. You can use the Lock Control Turnout to
enable or disable the Route Lock function from a Panel Turnout icon, a
layout turnout or a phantom turnout. A phantom turnout is a turnout that
can be accessed by your cab but doesn't actually exist on your layout.</p>

<p>For more information on how to set Turnouts to be lockable,
please see the <a href="TurnoutTable.shtml#Turnout%20lock%20feature">Turnouts
Table page</a>.</p>
